# Customized-LLM-APP

## Overview

This code is designed to create a chatbot that functions as an Italian chef, providing users with recipes and culinary advice. The chatbot leverages a PDF of Italian recipes, a SentenceTransformer model for semantic search, and the Hugging Face API for generating responses. The application is built using Gradio for the user interface.

## How It Works

### Components

1. **Gradio**: A Python library to create user interfaces for machine learning models.
2. **Hugging Face API**: Used for generating responses from a language model.
3. **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: A library to extract text from PDF files.
4. **Sentence Transformers**: A library to generate sentence embeddings.
5. **Faiss**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

### Functionality

#### 1. Initializing the App

The `MyApp` class is initialized, setting up the application's state, loading the PDF, and building the vector database for semantic search.

#### 2. Loading the PDF

The `load_pdf` method extracts text from each page of the provided PDF file and stores it in the `documents` list.

#### 3. Building the Vector Database

The `build_vector_db` method creates embeddings for the extracted text using the SentenceTransformer model. These embeddings are then added to a Faiss index for efficient similarity search.

#### 4. Searching Documents

The `search_documents` method takes a user query, generates an embedding for it, and uses the Faiss index to find and return the most relevant documents.

#### 5. Responding to User Queries

The `respond` function handles user interactions. It builds a conversation history, retrieves relevant documents based on the user query, and generates a response using the Hugging Face API.

### User Interface

The Gradio interface consists of a chatbot that provides examples of questions users can ask. It also includes a disclaimer noting that the chatbot is based on a publicly available Italian cuisine book and that the use of the chatbot is at the user's own responsibility.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `MyApp` class is initialized, setting up the necessary components such as documents, embeddings, and index.
   - The `load_pdf` method extracts text from the PDF file and stores it in the `documents` list.
   - The `build_vector_db` method generates embeddings for the text and adds them to a Faiss index.

2. **Document Search**:
   - The `search_documents` method takes a user query, generates an embedding for it, and searches the Faiss index for the most relevant documents.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The `respond` function handles the conversation, retrieves relevant documents, and generates responses using the Hugging Face API.

4. **Gradio Interface**:
   - The Gradio interface is set up to provide a chatbot interface with example queries and a disclaimer.

By following these steps, you can create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that enhances the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge from a PDF of Italian recipes.
